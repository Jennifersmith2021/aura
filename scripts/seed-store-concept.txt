// This script is intended to be run in the browser console or via a temporary component
// since it uses the client-side store hook.
// However, since I can't run browser console scripts easily, I will create a temporary 
// "Seeder" component that I can visit to populate the store.

// Actually, I can just use the browser subagent to execute JavaScript that interacts with the store 
// if the store is exposed to the window, OR I can just use the "Add Manual Expense" form 
// I created earlier to add items! 
// But the "Add Manual Expense" form in BudgetTracker sets category to "other" by default 
// and only allows "clothing" or "makeup" type. It doesn't let me set specific categories like "top".

// So, I will modify the BudgetTracker temporarily to allow setting specific categories 
// OR I will create a temporary page/component to seed data.
// A temporary component is cleaner.

// Wait, I can just use the `AmazonImport` logic? No, that also has specific logic.
// The easiest way is to create a temporary button in `FittingRoom.tsx` that adds test items.
// This is a "dev tool" approach.

// Let's modify `FittingRoom.tsx` to include a "Seed Test Data" button during development.
